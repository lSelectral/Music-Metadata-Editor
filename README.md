# Music-Metadata-Editor
This app edit the metadata of music files.

Currently supports only *.mp3 and *.flac formats.
You can edit the all metadata information of music files with this app.

You can use also built-in commands for quick swap between metadatas.

##Example

If you type {ARTIST} in any part you change, it will change to artist name.
That goes for:
--> {ARTIST}
--> {ALBUM}
--> {TITLE}
